App Description
To help bridge the gap between inpatient care and outpatient services to assist youth in recovery and preventing re-entry into "the life" of trafficking. The app should look discrete, similar to a wellness app so the patient would not feel endangered from their abusers, while giving them access to specific resrources based on their survey questions.
